[[zsh]]
## zsh warning - Maybe in an Intro vs. a Forward?

Since Catalina, the default shell is no longer Bash, but zsh. If you want to follow along with the tutorial, switch to a Bash shell by entering the following command:

[source,shell]
----
bash --login
----

You will see a warning:


The default interactive shell is now zsh.
To update your account to use zsh, please run `chsh -s /bin/zsh`.
